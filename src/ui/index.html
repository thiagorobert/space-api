    Usability and reliability are key differentiators in the fierce competition between Cloud Services Providers. As a Tech Lead in the area, I contributed to the launch of Cloud Run, Cloud Functions and Docker-based runtimes for AppEngine, products that ease the barrier of entry for potential customers. In the reliability space, I led technical efforts aiming at improving sovereignty, isolation, and at better informing existing and prospective customers about GCP reliability guarantees.

	  Project Glass was born out of a research project in Google X. Over the course of roughly 3 years, software, hardware, reliability, and manufacturing teams were assembled to breathe life into a new class of consumer electronics (CE) device. I joined the effort as the 8th member of the software team, which had grown to 75 engineers by the time I transitioned out of the project after the launch of Glass V1. During that time I had the chance to contribute to the best live demo of all times <a style='text-decoration: none;' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7TB8b2t3QE">&#128279;</a>, the launch of a developer API and SDK, and building an epic marketing campaign for the product. I also had the chance to learn valuable insights on CE manufacturing, marketing, and probably more than I wished to know about CE batteries.
